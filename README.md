## Problem Statement (by Mr Pankaj Sharma)

> Research and see if we can make our own streaming server.
> 
> It should be able to do following things:
> 
> 1. Pull RTSP
> 
> 2. GET RTSP pushed
> 
> 3. Generate RTSP and HLS streams
> 
> 4. Store, Export, Play DVR
> 
> 5. Return live thumbnail

## Push vs Pull protocols

> In *pull protocols*, consumers ask periodically their producers for values. The consumers signal their producers to send values. If there is a value waiting, the producer will send it down, or else it will block and wait to fulfill the demand.

whereas,

> In *push protocols*, the consumers open a connection to the server and keep it constantly active. The producer will send (push) all-new events to the consumers using that single always-on connection. In other words, the producer PUSHes the new events to the consumers.

## TCP vs UDP

> "Because UDP doesn’t support retransmissions, packet ordering, or error-checking, there’s potential for a network glitch to corrupt the data en route"

whereas,

> "TCP requires a three-way handshake when transporting data. The initiator (client) asks the accepter (server) to start a connection, the accepter responds, and the initiator acknowledges the response and maintains a session between either end"

## RTSP

> RTSP Requests
RTSP uses the following commands, typically sent from the client to the server, when negotiating and controlling media transmissions:

* Options: This request determines what other types of requests the media server will accept.
* Describe: A describe request identifies the URL and type of data.
* Announce: The announce method describes the presentation when sent from the client to the server and updates the description when sent from server to client.
* Setup: Setup requests specify how a media stream must be transported before a play request is sent.
* Play: A play request starts the media transmission by telling the server to start sending the data.
* Pause: Pause requests temporarily halt the stream delivery.
* Record: A record request initiates a media recording.
* Teardown: This request terminates the session entirely and stops all media streams.
* Redirect: Redirect requests inform the client that it must connect to another server by providing a new URL for the client to issue requests to.
* Other types of RTSP requests include ‘get parameter,’ ‘set parameter,’ and ’embedded (interleaved) binary data,’


## HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)

#### .M3U8 Manifest File

> [m3u8 tags](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8216)
> 
> "HLS video segments are indexed into a media playlist so that the video player understands how to organize the data. A master .m3u8 playlist file must also be created — think of this as the index of indexes — to instruct the player on how to jump between the variant-specific playlists. This is also referred to as the manifest file. Anyone delivering the stream can then distribute the content by embedding the .m3u8 reference URL in a web page or creating an application that downloads the file."
